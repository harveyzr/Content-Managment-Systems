 ## Description
The main goal of this application is to use the skills we learned in class to create a coding quiz.

 Code quiz is the 12th challenge for the Ohio State coding bootcamp.
-	My motivation for this project was to become proficient at coding SQL, Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.  
-	Building this project allowed me to implement coding techniques that I have been studying halfway through this bootcamp. 
-	This was a great example of real world examples with no start code.  
-	I learned how to code and deploy backend interfaces.
